# 🌍 Earth Changelog: Patch Notes for Reality

## 📌 About the Project
The **Earth Changelog** is a video game-style patch notes system that tracks real-world events as if they were game updates. It covers **historical updates from 0 AD to today** and **daily changelogs starting December 2024 at 7 PM EST.**

## 🔥 Features
- **📜 Historical Changelogs** → Yearly patch notes from **0 AD to present**.
- **📅 Daily Updates (from Dec 2024 - Feb 2025)** → Auto-generated changelogs for each day.
- **🤖 AI-Powered** → Uses AI to generate non-biased, game-style summaries of real-world events.
- **🌐 Hosted on GitHub Pages** → Free, accessible, and constantly updated.
- **🗂 Categorized Entries** → Updates sorted into **Features, Nerfs, Buffs, and Bug Fixes.**
- **🔍 Search & Filtering** → Find updates by year, topic, or keyword.

## 📅 How It Works
1. **Historical Changelogs:** AI generates a backlog of yearly updates for past events.
2. **Daily Updates (Starting Dec 2024):**
   - At **7 PM EST daily**, a script fetches news headlines from reputable sources.
   - AI rewrites them into a patch note format.
   - The site updates automatically via GitHub Actions.
3. **Website:**
   - Interactive timeline or dropdown for easy navigation.
   - Users can browse changelogs, search by topic, and filter updates.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (GitHub Pages hosted)
- **Backend Automation:** Python (for AI-generated content)
- **Data Sources:** Public news APIs (e.g., Reuters, AP News)
- **Automation:** GitHub Actions (runs the AI script & updates site daily)
